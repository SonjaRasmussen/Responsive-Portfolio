        Wow! You found my page.  Wait, I have a “page”! I’m thrilled you’re here.  I am Sonja Rasmussen, a middle aged and socially irrelevant mother of 2 young boys.  For the past 7 years I’ve been opting out of the business world and leaning into the stay at home mom world.  I went from managing $500M corporate budgets to changing 3-4 diapers a day, cleaning up poop and playing with Hot Wheels.  Rather than meeting colleagues for drinks after work to discuss business strategies and opportunities, I am making dinner, giving baths, reading bedtime stories and falling asleep at 8:30 pm.  

    </p> <p>Seriously though,  I am Canadian.  We moved to San Francisco 6 years ago for my husband’s career.  Living in San Francisco was hands down the best city I’ve ever lived in and I’ve lived in a few places. We moved to Seattle in 2017, bought a house and decided to settle down for a while.
        
        I am so excited to be challenging myself by taking a web development course at <abbr> UW</abbr> and I can’t wait to see my progress over the next 6 months.
